So, i'm trying to make something???
not sure how far this "project" will survive, but i'll TRY to keep it up
To do:
- ~~make the code work at ALL~~ DONE
- add more functions, still wip
- ~~adjust variable names~~ done, added class
- ~~MAYBE, make it show on a console~~ depends on where you run it
- i'm not gonna get into ui territory because that's not happening
